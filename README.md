# 🧪 Periodic Table of Process Improvement Tools

An interactive reference tool for engineers, project managers, and Lean Six Sigma teams to explore, understand, and apply process improvement tools visually — inspired by the periodic table.

## 🎯 Purpose

Most process improvement frameworks list dozens of tools (e.g., Fishbone, SIPOC, Pareto), but few people remember when to use each one. This app organizes them into a structured, colorful, easy-to-use web table with built-in AI explanations.

## 💡 Features

- 🎨 Periodic Table Layout — Visually grouped by category and function
- 🧠 Gemini AI Integration — Click on any tool to get a simple explanation of how and when to use it
- 📱 Mobile-Responsive Design — Works on laptops, tablets, and phones
- 🔍 Tooltips — Hover to preview purpose before clicking
- 🧰 Ideal for:
  - Six Sigma Green/Black Belt training
  - Continuous improvement workshops
  - Quick reference for project teams

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- Gemini API for natural-language tool explanations
